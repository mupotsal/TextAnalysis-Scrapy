Is a MTG endorsement inevitable? ,"By , ,Presented by Anbaric Development Partners, in a New Jersey congressional primary?,The Daily Beast reports that an endorsement by the far-right Georgia congresswoman who just confused the Gestapo with gazpacho is the ,, after only Donald Trump himself., But other far-right figures have been sought after. I’ve seen at least two Republican congressional candidates burnish endorsements from Michael Flynn, , QAnon-promoting retired general who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI. And operative Roger Stone, ,commuted by the former president, , for the Monmouth GOP convention to assist Republican podcast host Mike Crispi in his effort to oust longtime incumbent Chris Smith (R-4th Dist.). (Smith ,).,, it seems that nothing can make you toxic as long as it’s been in service to the former president and the lies he spreads about the 2020 election.,: “Without question, we have one of the largest ports in the country and knocking on wood with our folks have managed it brilliantly in the context of this pandemic, but that trucker reality is a threat without question.’ — Gov. Phil Murphy , — Political consultant ,former Norcross aide,Burlco GOP operative, At Camden County College for a 10 a.m. Donald Norcross campaign kickoff, then in Willingboro at 2:15 pm for an announcement.,?

Their reaction was harsh. ‘They laughed at me,’ he said. He even remembered a top senator predicating at the time it would lead to Scutari getting booted from Trenton. ‘He’s like, ‘That’s the stupidest idea I ever heard. You’re gonna have a short career, young man,’’ Scutari said. ‘And I’m like, ‘Am I? Did I do something wrong here? I think it’s the right thing.’’ After years of pushing the change, weed is now legal in the Garden State. And, Scutari, now 53, is still in office. In fact, after Jersey politics took a mighty strange turn on Election Day, the Union County Democrat is now the one in charge of the state Legislature’s upper house. Scutari was sworn in last month as the 115th president of the New Jersey Senate, making him the second most powerful politician in state government, trailing only the governor. That’s the part that truly surprises him. ‘I don’t know if I ever envisioned it or looked for it,’ Scutari said during a wide-ranging interview with NJ Advance Media earlier this month at the two-story brick building in Linden that serves as both his law and legislative offices. ‘I think that’s one of the reasons I got it.’”,: “State appellate court has dismissed a legal challenge to Gov. Phil Murphy’s vaccine and booster mandate for corrections officers. In a unanimous 34-page published opinion Friday, the three-judge panel ruled Murphy was well within his authority to adopt the mandate, which had drawn sharp outcry from the state Policemen’s Benevolent Association, the state’s largest police union representing corrections officers. ""[T]here are times when individual self-interests like those asserted by appellants must take a backseat to the responsibilities we all have toward each other, a point President Kennedy far more eloquently expressed in his 1961 inaugural address,” Judge Clarkson Fisher Jr. wrote for the three-member panel in a scathing opinion. State PBA President Pat Colligan said in a brief interview that the union is considering its next steps, including a possible appeal to the state Supreme Court. “It’s a three-nothing decision, so it’s a very, very difficult hurdle to climb,” he said.,—, “With no vote-by-mail, no early voting, and no provisional ballots, some of our country’s highest voter turnouts took place in the earliest days of the Republic. In the presidential election of 1860, won by Abraham Lincoln, the turnout was 81%. Americans in the 1800s held sacred their constitutional right to vote. Today, despite there being more flexibility than ever in everyday life, it’s not the voters but politicians who are exerting themselves, with all kinds of changes to how we vote. The result is a confusing, unmanageable, expensive and, in some ways, dubious voting and election reporting system that has disenfranchised many voters.”,@Jack4NJ is incorrect. About 150,000 Union soldiers were able to vote by mail for the first time in 1864. Also, Lincoln never carried New Jersey or won any of our electoral votes, so it's a doubly ironic argument for a New Jersey leader to make.,—@,: “Weighed in with the NJ Legislative Apportionment Commission on perhaps the most peripheral issue of all: should the final map be renumbered so that, for example, District 30 isn't sitting in South Jersey?”,“Academy Bus will pay $20.5 million to settle a lawsuit filed by New Jersey accusing the private company of underreporting missed bus trips and by over-billing New Jersey Transit for hours and miles driven in what authorities described as an 'extensive multi-year, multi-million-dollar fraud.' The Hoboken-based company also agreed to be overseen by an independent monitor, implement new policies and add more training for employees to ensure Academy accurately log trips it fails to complete and how many miles its drivers travel, the state Office of the Attorney General said Friday. The agreement announced Friday is the state’s largest-ever non-health care False Claims Act settlement … The complaint also alleged that Academy’s internal records tracked two sets of bus trip numbers – the 'real' number of missed bus trips (which Academy labeled “RN”) and an adjusted set of numbers that was always significantly lower, and which Academy submitted to NJ Transit.”,“Sports gambling has become a $10 billion industry in New Jersey since it was legalized in June 2018, translating into $102.6 million in 2021 state tax revenue. But Jakubik, fellow recovering gamblers Joe and Frank — who requested pseudonyms in order to speak openly about their respective struggles — and advocates fear it’s a perilous gateway for a new generation of sports bettors who are one smartphone app from ruin. ‘The issue with gambling is it’s a hidden addiction,’ said Felicia Grondin, the executive director of the Council on Compulsive Gambling of New Jersey. ‘People are not willing to declare that they have a problem because they’re embarrassed. It’s shameful. There’s a lot of regret and remorse.’ The council has recently witnessed an unprecedented spike in helpline sports gambling calls, according to Grondin. About 3% of its calls involved sports betting before the state legalized it. That number jumped to 11% in 2018, 15% in 2019, 18% in 2020 and 17% in 2021. At one point during the COVID-19 pandemic, 29% of its calls were related to sports betting. ‘The pandemic definitely fueled the fire there,’ Grondin said.”,During a Friday visit to promote money from the bipartisan infrastructure law, Vice President Kamala Harris held up the city’s rush to replace thousands of lead pipelines as a national model for cities with the toxic metal in their water systems. Over the past three years, the city has replaced all 23,000 of the lead water service lines in the city — a remarkably quick solution to a long-standing problem. This is exactly what the Biden administration hopes other cities can do with the billions of dollars in the infrastructure package for lead line replacement, she said. “It's hurting our babies,” Harris said … High levels of lead began showing up in the Newark’s tap water in the mid-2010s, prompting obvious comparisons with the crisis in Flint. While local officials, including Baraka, initially dug in and denied the extent of the problems, they later chose to put money toward it. At a roundtable with Harris, Newark residents praised the speed and quality of the work, as well as the peace of mind they got from having unleaded pipes. “We’re going to take this and promote this all over the country,” [EPA Administrator Michael] Regan said.,“8th District congressional challenger Ricardo Rojas announced he was dropping out of the race [Friday] night, reflecting that “success is not a logistical possibility. ‘After long and hard discussions, I am suspending this campaign. We worked extremely hard this past month, and I now see that the runway is too short; that success is not a logistical possibility,’ Rojas said in a statement … With Rojas out of the race, Rob Menendez, the son of U.S. Senator Bob Menendez (D-NJ), has an even clearer path to victory.”,“Two South Jersey men have pleaded guilty in connection to their roles in the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. Robert Lee Petrosh of Mays Landing and Lawrence Stackhouse of Gloucester Township are the first of at least 11 suspects from South Jersey to admit guilt to charges arising from the insurrection. Petrosh acknowledged he entered the Capitol and stole two microphones during the uprising by supporters of then-President Donald Trump, a court record says. The theft occurred after Petrosh had told U.S. Capitol Police officers engaged in a stand-off with rioters, ‘Give us Nancy (Pelosi), and we will leave,’ the record adds.”, Join POLITICO for a discussion with health care providers, policymakers, federal regulators, patient representatives, and industry leaders to better understand the latest policy and industry solutions in place as we enter year three of the pandemic.

Two cars behind, Neptune police Officer Brooke Tartis saw the turn and followed to initiate a traffic stop, according to public records obtained by the Asbury Park Press. The offense? The SUV driver, Tristan Charleau, drove across private property instead of finding a legal detour for West Bangs Avenue, which was closed that day at Route 33. Tartis issued two tickets for what Monmouth County Prosecutor's Office later deemed to be ‘clear’ traffic violations. That traffic stop, however, led to murky waters for Charleau's mother-in-law, Committeewoman Tassie York, whose conduct after the stop — along with that of the township's municipal prosecutor — has been sent to a state ethics panel for review. Audio of what York said that led to the ethics review as well as video of her son-in-law's traffic stop was released this week after a public records request by the Press. While the Prosecutor's Office found 'no misconduct whatsoever by any of the officers involved,' they did question if York was using her elected position to benefit her son-in-law and if Municipal Prosecutor James N. Butler Jr. should have recused himself from the case.”,“Gusciora has a reputation for thinking outside the box. This plan is a box on wheels. Each would hold up to eight passengers – but no driver. Gusciora said the plan will be a model for cities across the nation. So far there have been a number of demonstration projects in which autonomous vehicles – AVs for short – have navigated some small areas, 'but this will be the first entire city to be covered,' the mayor said. There will be 60 kiosks at locations around the city where people can get on the 100 AV’s that make up the fleet, he said. They can then type in their destinations and the AV will drop each passenger off in a sequence determined by the computers. The obvious question is: Are these things safe? ‘The first two years we are going to have drivers as a fail-safe measure,’ Gusciora said. But the hope is that the technology will make an AV safer than a car driven by a human.”,“Sabrina Chacon was relieved when schools opened for full-time, in-person learning in September 2021, a year and a half after the pandemic hit. Her son Matthew, a Ho-Ho-Kus School District third-grader, needed to be back in the classroom after a year of disruptions. He had missed out on his speech therapy, which he had been receiving since preschool … To her dismay, Chacon learned that come September, her son would resume the much-needed speech therapy class, but he and his therapist would be wearing masks. ‘It just never occurred to me that they were doing masked speech therapy,’ she said … The losses suffered from masked speech therapy for children with speech and language-related disabilities have not been accurately measured or studied, at least partly because school mask mandates are still in place in many states. Families and a small community of pediatricians and speech pathologists are left to bring attention to the situation, from what they see and from their deep knowledge about their children’s specific needs.”,“The principal scientist for the team behind the Webb telescope, now a million miles from Earth, is John Mather, who grew up in Sussex County making telescopes from lenses and mirrors in cardboard tubes and wooden boxes. His father was a Rutgers professor who conducted agricultural research at the university-owned Lusscroft Farm when Mather was a child. As he grew older, he knew agriculture wasn't going to be for him, because ‘cows were too big and scary.’ There was, however, a trip to the Museum of Natural History in New York, especially the planetarium and the large meteor in the museum's collection, which sparked an interest … Since, Mather has been awarded a Nobel Prize in Physics in 2006 for his work on the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE), a 1970s project which launch a satellite in 1989. The images and readings from that satellite became a landmark in modern cosmology by measuring the spectrum of the cosmic microwave background radiation.”,

The good news about deficits,"By , and , ,Presented by United We Succeed,While all eyes were on the latest inflation data, some remarkable news from the Treasury Department passed under the radar last week: The U.S. took in more money in January than it spent.,That’s right — the federal government ran a budget surplus last month for the first time since before the pandemic.,, and improving the fiscal picture at the same time., that White House officials have flagged since last summer, as fiscal policy ,, White House economist Jared Bernstein said Friday.,Month-to-month federal revenue and spending can be volatile — tax receipts always go up in the spring when people file their taxes, for example — so it helps to look at the trend over a 12-month period.,for the 12 months that ended in January was up 27.6 percent from the year before, as rising wages, low unemployment and robust economic activity push up individual and business tax receipts., for the 12 months that ended in January was still about 45 percent higher than it was in the year before the pandemic. But compared with the same period a year earlier, spending fell 3.4 percent — the first time 12-month outlays have declined since May 2014 — as the government spent less on pandemic aid and safety net programs, such as jobless benefits.,: Keep up with the latest critical developments from Ukraine and across Europe in our daily newsletter, National Security Daily.

For the 12 months that ended in January, the deficit shrank 34 percent from the same period year earlier, continuing a decline that began in June.,As a share of GDP, the 12-month deficit totaled 9.6 percent,,still high by historical standards, but nearly half of what it was when it peaked at 18.6 percent in March 2021 and the lowest it’s been since March 2020.,And while cumulative deficits over the past two years have added loads to the government’s bottom line — federal debt held by the public totals roughly $23 trillion, up from $17 trillion before the pandemic — the surge in economic growth has helped improve the overall debt picture.,Debt as a share of GDP has actually declined, from 100.8 percent in December 2020, to 96.5 percent at the end of last year — lower than the Congressional Budget Office projected it would be at any point over the next decade.,White House officials — as well as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and Governor Lael Brainard — have said waning fiscal support this year could act as a potential brake on the economy and help cool inflation pressures.,“Always important to not overinterpret [one] new data point,” Bernstein said on Twitter, , on the latest Treasury data. But “this may be an early sign of a shift we've long discussed” he added.,Republicans and some moderate Democrats, including Sen. Joe Manchin, have pointed to elevated deficits and debt, and the potential for them to fuel higher inflation, as a reason not to support the president’s social spending agenda. But it’s not clear that improving deficits alone would sway the West Virginia Democrat — he has called for any additional spending to not only be paid for but to reduce deficits, and last week he said , and “tackle inflation head-on.”, — interest rates. Net Interest payments on the federal debt last year totaled 1.5 percent as a share of GDP, below the historical average over the past 20 years and well within a range economists have suggested is fiscally sustainable.,Now, as the Fed seeks to rein in surging inflation, short-term interest rates are poised to rise dramatically. While rising prices can help the fiscal picture by inflating away the debt, higher rates could also push up the government’s interest costs this year — and it would only take a small adjustment to make a big difference, potentially on the order of billions of dollars a month.,It’s a talking point Republicans will surely seize on later this year, as they hammer Democrats over spending, debt and inflation., — Congrats to L.A.

Community banks and credit unions rely on revenue from card programs to serve low income and rural communities. These proposed regulations put those programs at risk. They would also threaten the security of credit cards by introducing alternative networks to process transactions - all without the consumers’ knowledge.

The IRS’ cybercrime unit has expanded from about five agents in 2015 to nearly 130 personnel today — in part because the agency combined its cybercrime and digital forensics team in July.,Jarod Koopman, acting head of the agency’s combined unit, also said the agency is opening a center in Northern Virginia later this year to bring together its cybercrime agents with other law enforcement partners as well as federal contractors who also focus on cryptocurrency investigations. “It’s almost like a cryptocurrency-fighting A-team,” Koopman said of the new center. “We’re trying to get the best of the best together to tackle some of the more challenging investigations that pop-up.”, — A press release on Friday from C5 Capital tells a simple story: Local cybersecurity investor André Pienaar dedicated $1.5 million to the U.S. Institute of Peace to honor the legacy of former South African president Nelson Mandela.

A judge ordered Pienaar on Feb. 7 to show proof that he’s made a roughly $500,000 payment to the Institute of Peace after the agency said it still hadn’t received a part of the funds it was promised last month. The parties are also scheduled to appear at a virtual status conference Tuesday to go over the matter, although the court order states it could be canceled if they reach an agreement beforehand.,A lawyer representing Pienaar told MC Sunday that the $1.5 million payment to the Institute of Peace mentioned in Friday’s press release was “essentially a substitute” to the original PeaceTech pledge that everyone’s been debating. “PeaceTech and Mr. Pienaar agreed to the USIP pledge instead,” said Teddy Baldwin, Pienaar’s lawyer, in an email.
